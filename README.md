# High-Five-Bot

Reddit bot written with the use of PRAW as a means to improve my abilities in Python as a developer.

**Usage:**

Sometimes a high-five is the most appropriate thing to do at the moment but since you're on Reddit, it leaves much to be desired. No longer--just comment *!highfive* or *!high-five* and the bot will reply to your comment with a notification that you high-fived someone and it will provide a link to a high-fiving GIF. Awesome.
